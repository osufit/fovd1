        <h2>Research Context and Rationale

          This study explores the impact of CodeChum, an online programming platform, on Grade 11 ICT students at Tapinac Senior High School. Given the increasing importance of coding in various industries, platforms like CodeChum aim to make programming education more engaging and accessible. While CodeChum offers interactive exercises, structured courses, and real-time feedback, limited research exists on its effectiveness compared to traditional methods.
          
          The research seeks to examine the perceived effects of CodeChum on students' programming performance and engagement, addressing challenges, benefits, and potential improvements.</h2>

        Scope and Limitations

The study is limited to Grade 11 ICT students at Tapinac Senior High School and focuses solely on CodeChum, excluding other programming platforms. It examines perceived programming improvements rather than broader cognitive or social effects.

By addressing gaps in research, the study aims to provide insights for educators, policymakers, and industry stakeholders on improving programming education.
